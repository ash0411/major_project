# topic_classification_of_research_articles
This is my simple major project on classification of research papers into 25 categories
The repo has several files depicting different approaches to the model.<br>
The first file does visualization and machine learning appraches. <br>
The second file uses word embeddings and Basic LSTM layers as a approach. <br>
The third file uses the approach of using the combination of attention layers with layers like LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU and Convolution layers.
